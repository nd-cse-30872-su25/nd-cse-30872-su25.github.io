    **Everyone**:

    Welcome to [CSE 30872 Programming Challenges], which (as the syllabus
    states) is a "course that revolves around solving *brain-teaser* and
    *puzzle-type* problems that often appear in programming contests, online
    challenges, and job interviews".  What this means is that we will be
    studying common data structures, algorithms, and programming techniques
    that are useful in tackling a variety of problems.

    <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">

    #### <i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i> TL;DR

    For this week, you familiarize yourself with using [Zoom] and [Slack] and
    then setup your [GitHub] assignments repository.

    </div>

    ## Course Overview

    Last year, many of you took the **Data Structures** course where you
    learned about the properties and characteristics of different data
    structures (*and perhaps you even implemented a few*).  The focus of this
    class, however, is not in the *construction* of these data structures, but
    rather their *application*.  This means we will focus on *when* to use
    these data structures and algorithms and *how* to utilize them effectively
    rather than *what* they are.  In concrete terms, we will not be
    implementing say a [hash table]; instead we will use one to solve a variety
    of problems.

    Following the [Hands-On Imperative], you will have the opportunity to put
    the material we discuss in class into practice via a *respectful* number of
    weekly **programming challenges** (**three a week**).  Along with these
    challenges will be **reading assignments** to ensure you have a context or
    background knowledge for what we will be discussing in class.  As with last
    semester in [Systems Programming], the reading assignments will be
    automatically graded.

    In fact all of your assignments will be automatically graded by [dredd] via
    the [continuous integration] system provided by [GitHub].  As you may be
    realizing during your internship or research experience this summer,
    **testing** is an important part of software engineering and we will
    therefore explore various aspects of **software development** including
    debugging, profiling, testing, and more throughout the course (*if there is
    time*).

    Additionally, to give you practice using **AI** in a productive manner, you
    will be required to perform one [code review] a week on one of your
    **programming challenges** using an **AI agent** of your choice (ie.
    [Gemini], [ChatGPT], etc.).

    Although each class will involve some amount of lecture, there will also be
    a lot of in-class activities and hands-on learning.  Because of this,
    **participation** is a component of your grade and you are expected to come
    to class **regularly** and **on-time**.

    Fortunately, however, there are **no exams** in this class.  Instead, we
    will have a final **in-class programming contest** where you will get to
    work in groups of `1` or `2` (similar to the [ACM Programming Contest]).

    Likewise, you will also have to participate in **two external programming
    contests** such as those provided by [HackerRank] or [LeetCode].

    ## Task 1: Zoom

    For all of our class meetings, we will be using [Zoom] to video conference.
    Before our first class meeting, make sure you can login to the [Zoom]
    system and access our [meeting link]:

    > [https://notredame.zoom.us/j/98403023681](https://notredame.zoom.us/j/98403023681)

    <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
    #### Notes

    - You will need to use the Notre Dame [Zoom] login system.

    - You will need to download and install the [Zoom] client to perform video
      conferencing.

    - By default, you microphone will be **muted**.  To speak, you will need to
      manually unmute it.
    </div>

    [meeting link]: https://notredame.zoom.us/j/95360142593

    ## Task 2: Slack

    For communication outside of our meeting time, we will be using [Slack],
    specifically the `#cse-30872-su25` channel:

    > [https://nd-cse.slack.com/messages/cse-30872-su25/](https://nd-cse.slack.com/messages/cse-30872-su25/)

    There is a [class mailing list], but most day-to-day communication
    (including office hours and homework help) should take place on [Slack].

    [class mailing list]: mailto:su25-cse-30872-01-group@nd.edu

    <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
    #### Notes

    - You will need to signup and create a [Slack] account if you don't already
      have one.

    - You can use the web interface or download the [Slack] desktop client
      (there are also mobile applications as well).

    - Feel free to join any other channels that may interest you.
    </div>

    ## Task 3: GitHub

    All of your work will be submitted to [GitHub] using [git]. Your final task
    is to setup your [GitHub] repository by doing the following:

    1. **Sign-in** or **create** a [GitHub] account if you do not already have one.

    2. **Fork** the class assignments repository from the following template:

        > [https://classroom.github.com/a/nuiwm_s1](https://classroom.github.com/a/nuiwm_s1)

        This will create a **private** `assignments-$USERNAME`
        repository under your own account and linked to the [nd-cse-30872-su25]
        organization.

    <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
    #### <i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub Repository

    You are responsible for ensuring that your [GitHub] assignments repository
    is in proper order, which means you have the correct settings and
    permissions set.  Failure to properly configure your repository will
    adversely impact your grade.

    </div>

    ## Task 4: Student Machines

    While you are free to use any machine you wish to do your work, the
    department provides a set of **student machines** that you can login to and
    do remote work in an environment crafted for the course.  The following
    steps allow you to **clone** the **assigments** you just created to any
    machine of your choosing.

    <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
    #### <i class="fa fa-server"></i> Student Machines

    As a reminder, students in this class have access to the following
    **student** machines:

    - `student05.cse.nd.edu`
    - `student10.cse.nd.edu`
    - `student11.cse.nd.edu`
    - `student12.cse.nd.edu`
    - `student13.cse.nd.edu`

    To access the **student** machines from off-campus, you can either setup
    [VPN] access or login to `jumpbox.nd.edu` first, and then to any of the
    **student** machines.

    </div>

    1. Before you can **clone** your [git] repository, you will need to
    determine which form of **authentication**, you wish to use with [GitHub].

        To remotely access your repository from the command-line, you have two options:

        1. [Setup SSH Keys]: With this method, you generate a local public and
          private key pair on your computer and then upload the **public key**
          to [GitHub].  When accessing [GitHub] from the command-line, you will
          use the **private key** to authenticate to the server.

            This is the **recommended** way to setup your repository as it will
            allow for **passwordless** access.

        2. [Setup a Personal Access Token]: With this method, [GitHub] will
          generate an application specific passsword that you can use with
          **HTTPS**.  As the **PAT** is a long string of characters, it is
          recommended that you use it in conjunction with a **password
          manager** or **keyring**.

        <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
        #### <i class="fa fa-lock"></i> Setup SSH Keys

        <p>Here is a quick tutorial on how to [Setup SSH Keys] on the student
        machines (if you have not already):</p>

        1. Generate SSH keys if you don't have them yet:

                :::bash
                # Accept the defaults, don't make a password if you want to go passwordless
                $ ssh-keygen

        2. Copy the contents of `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to the SSH Keys section of
        your [GitHub] settings page:

            > [https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)

                :::bash
                # Copy and paste the contents of this file into GitHub
                $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

        3. Edit/create `~/.ssh/config` to use this key with [GitHub]:

                :::bash
                # Add the following to your config (replace $NETID with your netid)
                $ vim ~/.ssh/config
                Host github.com
                        User git
                        Hostname github.com
                        PreferredAuthentications publickey
                        IdentityFile /escnfs/home/$NETID/.ssh/id_rsa

        Once this is done, you should be able to do [git] operations without a password.
        You will need to accept the host key the first time by typing in "yes".
        </div>

        <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
        #### <i class="fa fa-code"></i> Text Editor

        Any time you see references to `vim` in example commands, remember that
        you can use any text editor such as `nano` or `emacs` instead.

        </div>

    2. **Clone** your [git] repository to your local machine (or the student machines):

            :::bash
            # Example of cloning GitHub assignments repository to local or student machine
            $ git clone git@github.com:nd-cse-30872-su25/assignments-$USERNAME.git

    3. **Edit** the `README.md` file in your **assignments** repository such
    that the **Name** and **NetID** fields are completed (i.e. replace "Domer
    McDomerson" and "dmcdomer"). You should **commit** your change and then
    **push** them to [GitHub].

            :::bash
            # Example on editing README in assignments repository and pushing changes to GitHub

            $ cd assignments-$USERNAME   # Go into the assignments directory

            $ nano README.md                            # Edit the README.md file

            $ git add README.md                         # Mark the file for recording

            $ git commit -m "Update README"             # Record the change
            [master c550fa1] Update README
            1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)

            $ git push                                  # Send your local changes to GitHub

    <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
    #### <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Tasks

    Once you have setup [Slack], [GitHub], and have a working development
    environment on your local machine or on a **student machine**, then you
    have completed all the necessary tasks for this **reading assignment**.
